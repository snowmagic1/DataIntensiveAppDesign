partition and replication
partition is usually combined with replication so that copies of each partition are stored on different nodes. this means that even though each record belongs to exactly one partition, it will still be stored on several different nodes for fault tolerance.

partition of key value data
- partition by key range
  + range scan
  - hotspot
- partition by hash of key

skewed workload and relieving hotspot
partitioning and secondary index
- partition secondary index by document
  local partition, scatter/gather
- partition secondary index  by term
  global, the term we're looking for determines the partition of the index

rebalancing partitions
minimum requirements
- after rebalancing, the load(read/write, storage) should be shared fairly between the nodes in the cluster
- while rebalancing is happening, the database should continue accepting reads and writes
- no more data than neccessary should be moved between nodes, to make rebalancing fast and to minimize disk and network load
