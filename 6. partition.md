partition and replication
partition is usually combined with replication so that copies of each partition are stored on different nodes. this means that even though each record belongs to exactly one partition, it will still be stored on several different nodes for fault tolerance.

partition of key value data
- partition by key range
  + range scan
  - hotspot
- partition by hash of key
