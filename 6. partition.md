partition and replication
partition is usually combined with replication so that copies of each partition are stored on different nodes. this means that even though each record belongs to exactly one partition, it will still be stored on several different nodes for fault tolerance.

partition of key value data
- partition by key range
  + range scan
  - hotspot
- partition by hash of key

skewed workload and relieving hotspot
partitioning and secondary index
- partition secondary index by document
  local partition, scatter/gather
- partition secondary index  by term
  global, the term we're looking for determines the partition of the index

rebalancing partitions
minimum requirements
- after rebalancing, the load(read/write, storage) should be shared fairly between the nodes in the cluster
- while rebalancing is happening, the database should continue accepting reads and writes
- no more data than neccessary should be moved between nodes, to make rebalancing fast and to minimize disk and network load

stragegies for rebalancing
- hash mode N
- fixed number of partitions
choose the right partition number if hard
- dynamic partition
- partition porpotional to nodes

operations - automic or manual rebalancing
request routing
- allow the client to connect to any nodes, if the node coincidently owns the partiton to which the request applies, it can handle the requests directly; otherwise it forwards the request to appropriate node, receive the reply and pass the reply along to the client
- send all requests from clinet to a routing tier first, which determines the node that should handle that request and forward it accordingly,this routining tier does not itself handle any requests, it only acts as a partiotn aware load balancer
- require the client to be aware of the partiotn and the assignment of partitons to nodes, in this case, the client can connect to the appropriate node directly, without any intermidiatry.

in all cases, the key problem is that how does the component makes the routine decision learn about the changes in the assignment of partiotn to nodes?
