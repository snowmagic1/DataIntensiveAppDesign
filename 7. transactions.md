a transaction is a way for an appliction to group several reads and writes into a logical unit.
conceptually all reads and writes are executed as one operation.

atomicity
in general atomicity means the opeartion can not be broken into smaller parts. in multi threads programming, if one thread performs an atomic operation, that means there's no way that another thread can see the half finished result of the operation, the system can only be in the state it was before the operation or after the operation, not something in between.
ACID atomicity describes what happens if the client wants to do several writes, but a fault occurred after some of the writes have been processed, the database has to discard or undo any writes it has made so far in that transaction.

the idea of ACID consistency is that you have certain statements about your data(invariance) that must always be true, 

Isolation in the sense of ACID means concurrently executing transactions are isolated from each other, they can't be overlapped.

the purpose of database is to provide a safe place where data can be store without fear of losing it.
