1. one of the replica is desinated the leader, when clients want to write, it must send the request to hte leader, which first write the new data to its local storage
2. the other replicas are known as followers, whenever the leader writes new data to its local storage, it also sends the chagnes to all its followers as part of the replication log, each followers take the log from the leader and update its local storage accordingly, by applying all the writes the same order as they were processed on the leader.
3. when a client wants to read from the database, it can query either the leader or any of the followers, 

sync vs async replication
setting up new followers
handling node outages
- follower failure, catch up recovery
- leader failure, failover
  - detech leader failre
  - select a new leader
  - reconfigure the system to use the new leader

implementation of replication log
- statement based replication, non determintisc, concurrent
- WAL shipping, very low level
- logical(row based) replication, bin log
- trigger based replication

problems with replication lag
- reading your own writes
  1. when reading something the user may have modified, read it from the leader, otherwise, read it from the followers
     this requires you have some ways of knowing that whether something may have modified, without querying it.
     eg. user profile info is normally editable by the owner of the profile, not by anybody else. thus the simple rule is always reads user's profile from the leader, and any other user's profile from the followers
  2. if most things are protentially editable by the user, that approach won't be effective, as most things would be read from the leader, negating the benifit of read scaling.in that case, other cretiera may be used to decide wheter to read from the leader. eg. you can track the time of the last update, for one minute after the last update, make all reads from the leader.
you could also monitor the replication lag on followers and prevent queries on any followers that is one minute behind the leader.
  3. the client can remeber the timestamp of its most recent write, then the system can ensure that the replica that servers any reads from that user reflects updates at least util that timestamp. if the replica is not sufficiently update to date, either the read can be handled by another replica, or the query can wait util the replia has caught up.
  4. if your replicas are distributed across multiple data centers, there is additional complexity. any requests that need to be served by the leader has to be routed to the data center that contains the leader.
 
 another complexity arises when the same user accessing the service from multiple devices, 
 
- monotonic readsusually

  one way of acheving monotonic reads is to make sure that each uses always makes their reads from the same replica, 
- consistent prefix read

  violation of causaty. if a sequence of writes happen in certain order, then anyone reading these write will see them appearing in the same order.
  problem with partitions, no global ordering of writes,

solutions to replication lag - transactions

multi leader replication
use cases
- multi datacenter operations
- clients with offline operations
- collaborative editing
