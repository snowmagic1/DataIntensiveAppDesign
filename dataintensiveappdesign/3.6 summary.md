we try to get to the bottom of how databases handle storage and retrieval. 

on a high level, storage engines fall into 2 broad categories, those optimized for transaction processing, and those optimized for analytical. there're big differences between access patterns in those use cases:
- oltp usually is user facing, which means they may see a huge volume of requests. in order to handle the load, applications usually only touch a small number of records, applications request records using some kind of key, and the storage engine uses an index to find the requested keys, disk seek time is usually the bottleneck here
- olap handles a much lower volume of requests than oltp, but each query usually is quite demanding, requiring many millions of records to be scanned in a short time, disk bandwidth is usually the bottleneck here and column oreited storage is an increasing popular solution

on oltp side, we saw storage engines from 2 main school of thoughts
- the log structured school, which only allows appending to files and deleting obselete files, but never update files that has been written
- the update in place school, which treats disks as a set of fixed size pages that can be overwritten, b- tree is the biggest example in this philosophy, being used in many dbs.

as an application developer, if you're armed with this knowledge about the internals of storage engine, you're in a better position to know which tools is better suited for your work load,
