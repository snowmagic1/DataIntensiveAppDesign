- with a server side application, you may want to perform a rolling update, deploying the new version to a few nodes at a time, checking if the new version is running smoothly, and gradually working your way through all the nodes.this allows the new version to be deployed without service downtime, and thus encourage frequent release and better evolvability.
- with client side applications, you're at the mercy of the user, who may not install updates for some time.

this means the old and new versions of the code, and the old and new data formats, may protentially coexist in the system at the same time.

programs usually work with data in at least 2 different reprensations
- in memory
- save them into files or send them over the network

json and xml
- encoing numbers
- binarys
- schema

so we can see that although the textual data formats such as xml,json and csv are widespread, binary formats based on schema is also a viable option, they have a number of nice properties
- they can be much compact than various binary json varirance, since they can omit field names from the encoded data
- the schema is a valuable documentation,and since schema is requred for decoding, you can be sure that it is up to date.(whereas manually maintained documentation may easily deverge from reality)
- for users of statically typed program langugages, the ability to generate code from schemas is useful, since it enables type checking at compile time.

In summary, schema evolution allows the same kind of flexibility as schemaless/schema on read json databases provide, which also provides better guratteen about your data and better tooling.

many services need to support rolling updates, where a new version is gradually deployed to a few nodes at a time, rather than deploying them to all nodes simoutanously. rolling upgrades allows new version to be released without downtime, thus encourage releasing freqent small releases over rare big releases, and make deployment less risky, allowing faulty releases to be detected and rolled back before affacted large number of users. these properties are hugely benificial for evolviablility.
