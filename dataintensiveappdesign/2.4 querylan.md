declarative querying language
map reduce
a farily low level programming model for distributed execution on a cluster of machines
a usability problem with map reduce is you have to carefully write 2 coordinated functions, which is harder than writing a single query, moreover a declaritive query languge offers more oppotunities for a query optimizer to improve the performance for a query
