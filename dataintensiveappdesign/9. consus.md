the requirement of linerazibility is that the line joining up the operation markers always move forward in time, never backward. this requirement ensures the recency guranteen, once a new value has been written or read, all subsequent reads see the value that was written, util it's overwritten again.

- serializability
  it's an isolation property of transactions, where every transaction may read and write multiple objects, it gurattens that a transaction behave the same as if they are executed in some serial order, each transaction running to completion before the next transaction starts, it's ok for that serial order to be different from the order in which transactions were actually run.
  
  - lineraziblity
  it's a recency guratten on reads and writes of an individual object, it doesn't group objects together into transactions, so it doesn't prevent problems such as write skew
