- operatability
  make it easy for operation teams to keep the system running smoothly
- similicity
  make it easy for new comers to understand the system, by removing as much complexity from the system as possible
- evolvbility
  make it easy for engineers to make changes to the system in the future, adapting it for unexpected use cases as requirements change

one of the best tool we have to remove accidental complexity is abstraction, a good abstraction can hide a great deal of implementable detail behind a clean and easy to understand facade, it can also be used for a wide range of applications. not only is this reuse more efficient than reimplementing the similar a similar thing multiple times, but it also leads to higher quality software, quality improvement in the abstraction benifit all the applcation using it.
