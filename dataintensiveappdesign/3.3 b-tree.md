  the log structured index breaks the database down into variable sized segments, which is typically a few mb. in contrast, the b- tree index break the database down into fixed size blocks or pages, tranditionally 4k in size, read and write a page at a time. this design coresponds more closely to the underlying hardware as disk is also arranged in fixed size blocks.

## make b tree reliable
the basic write operation of a b tree is to overwritte a page on disk with new data, it is assumed that the overwrite doesn't change the location of the page, all reference to that page remain intact when the page is overwritten.this is in stark contrast with lsm tree, which only append to file, but never modify files in place

in order to make the database ressilent to crash, it's common for the b tree implementation to include an additional data structure on disk - a wal. this is an append only file to which every modification must be written before it can applied to the pages of the tree itself.after the database come back up after a crash, this log is used to restore the b tree back to a consistent state

## btree optimization
as b tree has been around for long, it's not supursing that many optimization has been developed over the years.
- immutable tree, instead of overwriting pages and maintaining wal, some dbs use copy on write schema, a modified version is written to another location, and a new version of parent page is created, pointing at the new page.this approach is also useful in concrrentcy control
- in general, pages can be positioned anywhere on disk, there's nothing requiring pages pages with nearby keys to be nearby ondisk.if a query needs to scan a large part of the key range in sorted order, this page by page layout can be inefficient, because a disk seek might be needed for every page that is read.many btree implemetation try to lay out the tree so that leaf pages appear in sequential order on disk
- additional pointers have been added, for example, each leaf pages may have references to its sibling pages to the left and right, which allows scanning keys in order without jumping back to parent page.
