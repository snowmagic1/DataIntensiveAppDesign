a btree has to write every piece of data to disk twice - once to wal, and once to the tree page itself. there's also overhead from having to write the entire page at a time, even if a few bytes in that page changed.

lsm also rewrite data multiple times due to repeated compaction and merging of sstable, this effect - one write to the database results in muliple writes to disk over the course of database lifetime, is known as write amplifier.

in write heavy application, the bottleneck might be the rate at which the database can write to the disk, in this case, the write amplifier has a direct perf cost, 

the downside of the log structured index is that the compaction process might interfere with the on going read and write, even though the storage engine tries to perform compaction increamentally and without affacting concurrent access, disks have limited resource, so it can easily happen that a request needs to wait while the disk finishes an expensive compation. 

an advantage of btree is that each key exists exactly once in the index, whereas a log structured index may have multiple copies of the same key in different segments.this aspect makes btree attractive to databases that want to offer strong transactional semantic,
