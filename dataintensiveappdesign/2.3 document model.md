document databases are somtimes called schemaless, but that's misleading, as the code that reads the data usually assumes some kind of structure, there's an implicity schema, but not enforced by the databse. a more accurate term is schema on read(the structure of data is implicit and only interpreted on read), in contrast with schema on write(schema is explicit and database enforce that all data written conform to it)

the differences between the approaches are particularly noticable in situations when the application wants to change the format of the data

document vs rational model
## which data model leads to simpler application code
## schema flexibility in document model
## data locality for queries
## Convergence of document and rational model
