a transaction is a way for an appliction to group several reads and writes into a logical unit.
conceptually all reads and writes are executed as one operation.

atomicity
in general atomicity means the opeartion can not be broken into smaller parts. in multi threads programming, if one thread performs an atomic operation, that means there's no way that another thread can see the half finished result of the operation, the system can only be in the state it was before the operation or after the operation, not something in between.
ACID atomicity describes what happens if the client wants to do several writes, but a fault occurred after some of the writes have been processed, the database has to discard or undo any writes it has made so far in that transaction.

the idea of ACID consistency is that you have certain statements about your data(invariance) that must always be true, 

Isolation in the sense of ACID means concurrently executing transactions are isolated from each other, they can't be overlapped.

the purpose of database is to provide a safe place where data can be store without fear of losing it.

multi objects vs single objects(cas)

week isolation levels
- read commited
  when reading from the database, you'll only see the data that has been commited(no dirty read), holding a short lock, snapshot
  when writing to the database, you'll only overwrite data that has been commited(no dirty write), holding a long lock

- snapshot, repeatable read
- prevent lost update, cursor stability, explicity locking
  automatically detect, cas
  conflict resolution and replication

write skew and phatom
read check update, update breaks the condition at step 2

serializability
- actual serial execution
serial execution of transactions have become a viable ways of serialization isolation within certain constrains
  - every transaction must be small and fast, because it takes only one slow transaction to stall all transaction processing
  - it is limited to uses cases that the active dataset can fit in memory
  - write throughput must be low enough to be handled on a single core, or else transactions need to be partitioned without requiring cross partition coordination
- two phase locking
even if you make sure you make all your transactions short, a queue may form if several transactions want to access the same object, so the transaction may have to wait for several others to complete before it can do anything
predicate lock
index range lock(next key lock)
- SSI
  - detect stale mvvc read
  - detect writes that affect the prior read
  
transaction is an abstraction that allows an appliction to pretent certain concurrency problems and certain hardware and software don't exist.

- dirty reads
- dirty writes
- read skew, non-repeatable read
- lost update
- write skew
  a transaction reads something, makes decision based on the value it saw, and writes the decision to the database.
  however, by the time the write is made, the premise of the desicion is no longer true, 
- phatom read
