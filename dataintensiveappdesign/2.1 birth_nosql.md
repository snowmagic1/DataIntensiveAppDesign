there're several driving forces behind the adoption of no-sql databases, including
- a need for a greater scalability that a rational database can easiler achieve, including very large dataset and high write throughput
- a widespread preference for free and open source software over commercial software
- specialized queries that are not well supported
- frastrution with the stictiveness of the schema, a desire to a more dynamic and express data model
